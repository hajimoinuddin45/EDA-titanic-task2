# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

This repository contains my work for **Task 2** of the ML data pipeline.  
The focus was on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns and relationships in the data using visualizations and statistics.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Explore the dataset deeply
- Understand trends, patterns, and hidden information
- Visualize relationships between features
- Use statistics to describe data

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

---

## 📈 EDA Steps Performed

1. **Summary Statistics**: Used `.describe()` to understand central tendency and spread.
2. **Histograms**: Plotted distributions of 'Age' and 'Fare'.
3. **Boxplots**: Used to detect outliers and understand variability.
4. **Correlation Matrix**: Found relationships between numeric variables.
5. **Pairplots**: Compared multiple features together, especially 'Survived'.
6. **Countplots**: Checked survival trends by gender and class.

## 🔍 Key Observations

- Younger passengers had higher survival chances.
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate.
- Passengers from higher classes had better chances of survival.
- 'Fare' and 'Pclass' are somewhat correlated with survival.
- Outliers are present in both Age and Fare columns.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- EDA helps find hidden patterns and understand data better.
- Boxplots are useful for spotting outliers.
- Pairplots and correlation matrices can show multicollinearity.
- Visualization is a powerful step before any ML modeling.
